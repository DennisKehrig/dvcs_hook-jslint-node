This is a port of https://github.com/jrburke/dvcs_jslint to use node.js

See the readme there for useage...

But here is a quick pre-commit hook:

#!/bin/sh
exec node https://github.com/wbecker/dvcs_hook-jslint-node/raw/master/dvcs_jslint.js https://github.com/tsmith/minlint/raw/master/minlint.js git
